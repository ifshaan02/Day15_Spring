Spring MVC Security

This project demonstrates the use of Spring MVC and Spring Security with JDBC authentication to create a custom login page for secure user access. Instead of the default login form, a fully customized login view is provided, allowing seamless integration with the applicationâ€™s design. User credentials and roles are stored in a relational database, and Spring Security is configured to authenticate users via JDBC-based authentication using queries mapped to the database schema. The configuration ensures secure login, logout, and role-based authorization while maintaining flexibility in UI design and security rules. This setup allows developers to combine database-driven authentication with a tailored user experience for login and access management.
